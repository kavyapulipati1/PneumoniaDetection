# 🧠 Pneumonia Detection with Deep Learning

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It's implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using TensorFlow and Keras. Aimed at applying AI in real-world medical diagnosis, this notebook walks through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


## 🚀 Project Goals

- Detect pneumonia from X-ray images using deep learning
- Learn and practice CNN architectures
- Build, train, and evaluate a binary image classifier
